    (GNU Privacy Guard) is a tool used for cryptographic signing, encryption, and verification. It uses public-key cryptography to ensure the authenticity and integrity of files or 
    packages. When a company (like Microsoft) distributes software, they also provide a GPG key to let users verify that the package is genuine and hasnâ€™t been tampered with.

    Workflow

            git add tells Git what changes to save.

            git commit saves those changes locally with a message.

            git push shares those changes with others on the remote repo.


            git push	        Local â†’ Remote      	Uploads your local commits to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub). This shares your changes with others.	After you commit changes and want to update the remote repo with your work.

            git pull	        Remote â†’ Local	        Downloads changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current local branch.	To update your local repo with othersâ€™ changes from the remote.
